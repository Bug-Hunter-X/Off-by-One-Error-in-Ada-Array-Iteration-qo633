This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Ada programming.  Ada arrays are 1-based indexed, unlike some other languages (like C/C++ or Python) which are 0-based indexed.  This simple example shows how easily a programmer, accustomed to 0-based arrays, can make this mistake and access memory outside of the array's bounds, leading to runtime errors or unpredictable behavior. The solution file shows the correct way to iterate through the array.  This is a great example for understanding the importance of careful attention to array indices in Ada.
